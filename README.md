# qfacebookconnect
This project is port of the Facebook connect for iphone to Qt

UPDATE:
Facebook is deprecating the old REST api upon which this library is based on. The new api is called facebook graph api and that should be used, the rest api breaks all the time so its not a good idea to use it. Please look at http://gitorious.org/qfacebook for a Qt implementation of the new facebook graph API.

This project is port of the Facebook connect for iphone to Qt, thus enabling Symbian, Maemo, any Qt supported platform to make api calls to Facebook's platform.

The facebook connect for iphone is available from http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Facebook_Connect_for_iPhone
